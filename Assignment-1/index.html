				<h3>Lyrics</h3>
				<p>I heard that you settled down</p>
				<p>That you found a girl and your married now</p>
				<p>I heard that your dreams came true</p>
				<p>Guess she gave you things I couldn't give to you</p>
				<p>Old friend why are you so shy ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light</p>
				<p>I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited, but I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it</p>
				<p>But I hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over</p>
				<h4>Chorus</h4>
				<p>Never mind I'll find someone like you</p>
				<p>I wish nothing but the best for you</p>
				<p>Don't forget me I beg I remember you said</p>
				<p>Sometimes it last in love but sometimes it hurts instead</p>
				<p>sometimes it last in love but sometimes it hurts instead</p>
				<h4>Verse 2</h4>
				<p>you know how the time flies, only yesterday was the time of our lives</p>
				<p>When we were young and brave in summer haste bound by the surprise of our glory days</p>
				<p>I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited, but I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it</p>
				<p>I had hoped you'd see my face and that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over</p>
				<h5>Refrain</h5>
				<p>Nothing compares, no worries or cares</p>
				<p>regrets and mistakes, they're memories made</p>
				<p>Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste</p>
